-> When u upload any attachment to the server we cant set the state value in the file file file . To solve this issue 
  eg:
<input type="file" name="att" onChange={this.attach}/>

 attach=(event)=>
 {
   if(event.target.files.length>0)
   {
       let attachdata=event.target.files[0];
   }
 } 
 -> When we send any attachment from react to node , we send the data with the help of FormData Object. 
 -> How we upload file in node | express 
   we have 1 middleware (multer) 
   backend 
   npm install multer --save
